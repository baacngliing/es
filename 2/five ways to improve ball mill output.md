## Rod Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Rod mills are used in an open circuit between crushing and the ball mill.They often operate in wet and where the pulp contains up to 50% solid by mass.This machine is equally very applicable to dry where it could take a feed that has achieved 6% moisture.As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.Ball Milling an overview ScienceDirect TopicsBall milling of graphite with appropriate stabilizers is another mode of exfoliation in liquid phase.21 Graphite is ground under high sheer rates with millimeter sized metal balls causing exfoliation to graphene (Fig.2.5),under wet or dry conditions.For instance,this method can be employed to produce nearly 50 g of graphene in the absence of any oxidant.22 Graphite (50 g) was ground in.
