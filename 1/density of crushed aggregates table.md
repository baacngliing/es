## Standard Test Method for Bulk Density ("Unit Weight") and.
1.1 This test method covers the determination of bulk density ("unit weight") of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination.This test method is applicable to aggregates not exceeding 125 mm [5 in.] in nominal maximum size.Section 902 AGGREGATESCrushed Concrete Aggregate.Crushed portland cement concrete.Salvaged Aggregate.Class 21AA,21A,22A,and 23A dense graded aggregates in accordance with Table 902 1,Table 902 2,and this subsection.Ensure dense graded aggregate produced by crushing portland cement concrete does not contain more than 5.0 percent building rubble or hot

## Density of Stone,crushed in 285 units and reference.
Stone,crushed weighs 1.602 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 602 kilogram per cubic meter,i.e.density of stone,crushed is equal to 1 602 kg m³.In Imperial or US customary measurement system,the density is equal to 100 pound per cubic foot [lb ft³],or 0.926 ounce per cubic inch [oz inch³].User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in.Unit Weight and Compacted Density: Crushed glass has a unit weight of approximately 1120 kg m 3 (70 lb ft 3),which is lower than that of conventional aggregate.The compacted density of crushed glass will vary with the size and grading of the glass as well as the degree of contamination (extraneous debris,such as paper,plastic caps,and soil).
