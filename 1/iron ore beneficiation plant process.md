## Iron ore Wikipedia
Lower grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation,using techniques like crushing,milling,gravity or heavy media separation,screening,and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.The results,high quality fine ore powders,are known as fines.Magnetite.Magnetite is magnetic,and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and.Iron Ore Beneficiation University of NewcastleIron Ore Beneficiation Introduction.Iron Ore Beneficiation increases the grade of iron whilst maximising recovery and reduces the content of ultrafine low grade slimes to maximise return on investment from the mining process prior to sale or further refining in the iron making process.

## Beneficiation Wikipedia
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation,with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
